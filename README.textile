tekBattleMapEnhancer is my feeble attempt to make the battle map actually useful in the outside world (as many of you know, I don't PvP).

Here's what tBME does:

* Scale up the battle map OnEnter, so that it's actually readable
* Make the background alpha lower and the "puzzle piece" alpha higher, to highligh the areas you've discovered
* Hide the map when the world map is open, so that you can actually view other zones (nice bug Blizzy!)
